        Born in the heart of the Lava Realm, Fireboy is a raging firestorm of flames. He is reckless, fearless, and stubbornly determined. Where there is peril that emerges, he is the one to rush into the fireâ€”literally.

        Though hot-headed on occasion, Fireboy is a brave and faithful one. He is a challenge eater, and when things start going tough, he fights through the fire.
        On his own, he can only achieve so much. But with Watergirl, they can ignite change together.</p>
