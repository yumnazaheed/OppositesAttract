      <p>Born in the heart of the Lava Realm, Fireboy is a blazing force of nature. Heâ€™s bold, impulsive, and fiercely determined. Wherever danger flares, heâ€™s the first to leap into the fireâ€”literally.

      But his power comes with limits. Water is his greatest enemy. A single drop can extinguish his strength. So he runs fast, jumps high, and avoids water at all costs.
      
      Though hot-headed at times, Fireboy has a strong sense of loyalty and courage. He thrives on challenge, and when things get tough, he pushes through the flames.
      
      Alone, he can only go so far. But with Watergirl by his side, they can ignite change together.</p>
